{"name":"RADL","tagline":"RADL: A specification and run-time metadata language for hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs","body":"RADL\r\n====\r\n\r\nIn a REST API, the server provides options to a client in the form of\r\nhypermedia links in documents, and the main thing a client needs to\r\nknow is how to locate and use these links in order to use the API. The\r\nmain job of a REST API description is to provide this information to\r\nthe client in the context of media type descriptions. Unfortunately,\r\nmost REST service description languages and design methodologies focus\r\non other concerns instead.\r\n\r\nRESTful API Description Language (RADL) is an XML vocabulary for\r\ndescribing Hypermedia-driven RESTful APIs. The APIs it describes may\r\nuse any media type, in XML, JSON, HTML, or any other format. The\r\nstructure of a RADL description is based on media types, including the\r\ndocuments associated with a media type, links found in these\r\ndocuments, and the interfaces associated with these links.\r\n\r\nRADL can be used as a specification language or as run-time metadata\r\nto describe a service. A JSON representation of RADL is under\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSee spec/RADL.html for documentation.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014, EMC Corporation\r\n \r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
